Installation
Installation is very easy and only takes a few seconds.

Requirements
Please make sure your computer/server meets the following requirements:

Node.js >= 9: Node.js is a server platform which runs JavaScript. Installation guide here.
MongoDB: MongoDB is a powerful document store. Installation guide here.
Setup
Time to install Strapi!

npm install strapi@alpha -g
Note: if you encounter npm permissions issues, change the permissions to npm default directory.

It takes about 20 seconds with a good Internet connection. You can take a coffee ☕️ if you have a slow one.

Having troubles during the installation? Check if someone already had the same issue https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues. If not, you can post one, or ask for help https://strapi.io/support.

Check installation
Once completed, please check that the installation went well, by running:

strapi -v
That should print 3.0.0-alpha.x.

Strapi is installed globally on your computer. Type strapi in your terminal you will have access to every available command lines.

Quick start
This section explains how to handle Strapi for the first time, (check out our tutorial video).

Create your first project
Creating your first project with Strapi is easy:

#1 — Open your terminal

Open your terminal in the directory you want to create your application in.

#2 — Run the following command line in your terminal:

strapi new my-project
Generate a Strapi project

This action creates a new folder named my-project with the entire files structure of a Strapi application.

#3 — Go to your project and launch the server:

In your terminal run the following commands:

cd my-project
strapi start
Start Strapi

Now that your app is running let's see how to create your first user.

Create your first user
In order to use the admin panel and to consume your API you first need to register your first user. This process only happens once if you don't have any user table created and is made to create the admin user that has all the permissions granted for your API.

If your using MongoDB for your database you don't have to create your table manually (it's already handled by Strapi) otherwise you'll have to create your user table first.

To create your first user, start your server (strapi start) and go to : http://localhost:1337/admin.

Register View

Now that your first user is registered let's see how to create your first api.

Create your first API
To create your first API, start your server (strapi start) and go to : http://localhost:1337/admin.

At this point, your application is empty. To create your first API is to use the Content Type Builder plugin: a powerful UI to help you create an API in a few clicks. Let's take the example of an e-commerce API, which manages products.

#1 — Go to the Content Type Builder plugin.

Content Type Builder - Home

#2 — Create a Content Type name Product and submit the form.

Content Type Builder - Create a new Content Type

#3 — Add three fields in this Content Type.

A string field named name.
A text field named description.
A number field named price (with float as number format).
Content Type Builder - List fields in Product

#4 — Save. That's it!

Note: See the CLI documentation for informations about how to do it the hacker way.

Files structure
A new directory has been created in the ./api folder of your application which contains all the needed stuff for your Product Content Type: routes, controllers, services and models. Take a look at the API structure documentation for more informations.

Well done, you created your first API using Strapi!

Manage your data
After creating your first Content Type, it would be great to be able to create, edit or delete entries.

#1 — Go to the Product list by clicking on the link in the left menu (generated by the Content Manager plugin).

Content Type Builder - Home

#2 — Click on the button Add New Product and fill the form.

Content Type Builder - Home

#3 — Save! You can edit or delete this entry by clicking on the icons at the right of the row.

Content Type Builder - Home

Consume your API
Your API is now ready and contains data. At this point, you'll probably want to use this data in mobile or desktop applications. In order to do so, you'll need to allow access to other users (identified as 'Guest').

1 - Go to the Auth & Permissions View by clicking on Auth & Permissions link in the left menu and click on the Guest Role item.

Auth & Permissions - Home

2 - Manage your APIs permissions in the Permissions section of the Edit Guest Role view by enabling or disabling specific actions.

Auth & Permissions - Edit Guest

List entries (GET)
To retrieve the list of products, use the GET /your-content-type route.

Generated APIs provide a handy way to filter and order queries. In that way, ordering products by price is as easy as GET http://localhost:1337/product?_sort=price:asc. For more informations, read the filters documentation

Here is an example using jQuery.

$.ajax({
  type: 'GET',
  url: 'http://localhost:1337/product?_sort=price:asc', // Order by price.
  done: function(products) {
    console.log('Well done, here is the list of products: ', products);
  },
  fail: function(error) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
  }
});
Get a specific entry (GET)
If you want to get a specific entry, add the id of the wanted product at the end of the url.

$.ajax({
  type: 'GET',
  url: 'http://localhost:1337/product/123', // Where `123` is the `id` of the product.
  done: function(product) {
    console.log('Well done, here is the product having the `id` 123: ', product);
  },
  fail: function(error) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
  }
});
Create data (POST)
Use the POST route to create a new entry.

jQuery example:

$.ajax({
  type: 'POST',
  url: 'http://localhost:1337/product',
  data: {
    name: 'Cheese cake',
    description: 'Chocolate cheese cake with ice cream',
    price: 5
  },
  done: function(product) {
    console.log('Congrats, your product has been successfully created: ', product); // Remember the product `id` for the next steps.
  },
  fail: function(error) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
  }
});
Update data (PUT)
Use the PUT route to update an existing entry.

jQuery example:

$.ajax({
  type: 'PUT',
  url: 'http://localhost:1337/product/123', // Where `123` is the `id` of the product.
  data: {
    description: 'This is the new description'
  },
  done: function(product) {
    console.log('Congrats, your product has been successfully updated: ', product.description);
  },
  fail: function(error) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
  }
});
Delete data (DELETE)
Use the DELETE route to delete an existing entry.

jQuery example:

$.ajax({
  type: 'DELETE',
  url: 'http://localhost:1337/product/123', // Where `123` is the `id` of the product.
  done: function(product) {
    console.log('Congrats, your product has been successfully deleted: ', product);
  },
  fail: function(error) {
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
  }
});
